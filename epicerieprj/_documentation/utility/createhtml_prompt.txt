Create a Python program that:

Asks the user to input a filename (either with or without .html extension) for a new HTML file.

Asks the user to input a description for the HTML content.

Copies the 'template_page.html' from the same folder to a new file with the user-specified filename (adding .html extension if not provided).

Modifies the new HTML file's content by replacing all occurrences of the word 'Index' with the user-provided description.

Handles potential errors like missing template file gracefully.

exit only when done
